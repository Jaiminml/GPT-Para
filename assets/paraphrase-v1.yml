  Original Text: Getting maximum value from IT is as much about how you manage it as it is about investing in it. From a business perspective it is about harmonizing IT; organizing IT; managing IT (Curley 2004), and identifying the value delivered to the organization (Prahalad and Hamel 1990, Sward and Haas 2003). Link this to UXD to deliver what the market wants and you have the basis for a competitive advantage (Sward 2006a). Understand how to do it continually and you have a sustainable competitive advantage to assist the corporate strategy (Porter 1987, Hamel and Prahalad 1994). Strategy one focuses on understanding the value delivered by solutions, strategy two focuses on getting UCD skills embedded in the organization, and strategy three focuses on effectively managing the UXD capability

  Paraphrased Text: To get the optimized value from IT to provide competitive advantage in the current business environment, management is the most important aspect. In a competitive world, we need businesses to help their best and brightest realize the greatest contribution. UXD (User Experience Design) is instrumental in helping us to deliver on this and get the maximum value from it. Doing this requires helping to manage the impact of this change on its activities in a practical way by helping them to communicate cross-functionally.
